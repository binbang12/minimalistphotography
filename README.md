### Onboarding
---
*This section goes over the process of onboarding a new mod. This includes letting them know our expectations of all mods, as well as getting them set up. For each potential new mod, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

1. **Explain the requirements and expectations of all mods on the team, those being:**

   Before we continue with the training, I'd just like to cover our expectations of every mod on the team. We ask that all mods:

   \- Dedicate 5-10 minutes a day to mod tasks, such as commenting on posts.  
   \- Notify the team in the Discord server (Mods-On-Break) if you're unnable to partipate for more than 48 hrs.  
   \- Maintain a respectful and friendly tone in all interactions with community members.
   \- Make an effort to keep things positive within the mod team, expressing encouragement and being respectful.  If you have criticism, try to deliver it paired with praise and discuss it privately in a direct message rather than in a group chat. 
   \- Actively participate in mod discussions on Discord, where we collaborate on decisions and improvements for the subreddit.

   Finally, while we cannot require mods to upvote nor tell them what to upvote, upvoting of posts and comments does make our sub seem more lively. Do with this as you will!
  
3. **Send the user a mod invite on Reddit. Give them the "user" and "flair" permissions. Once you've done this, let them know and ask them to give themselves the 'Mod' user flair. Also ask them to ensure their nickname in our discord server matches their username on Reddit (click on their icon, edit profile, change display name). This helps make sure everyone knows who's who, on both Reddit and Discord.**

4. **Once the new mod has completed Step 1 and 2, go on to explain that the way we moderate r/minimalistphotography is unique, and provide an overview as to what we do differently.**

   I'd now like to share a bit about our moderation process, as we do things differently compared to most other subreddits. Some of the things we do differently are:
   
   \- Every post submitted to our subreddit is removed and voted on by the mod team to determine if it aligns with our concept of minimalism  (which is constantly evolving as we learn and work with each other).
   \- We aim to have at least one mod comment on every post. This is an important part of what we do, as we believe it helps foster a welcoming and engaged community.  
   \- Some of our mods actively search for high-quality minimalist photos across reddit. If we find a photo on reddit that aligns with our concept of minimalism, we'll send the user an invitation to post it on our subreddit.

5. **Answer any questions the new mod may have, then continue on to explain the training process that they will go through.**

   Our training is designed to help you learn the tasks that need to be done to keep the subreddit running smoothly. To avoid overwhelming anyone with too much new information, you'll learn a new task every couple of days. The tasks that you'll be learning over the next week or so, in this order, consist of the following:
   
   \- Commenting on posts made in our sub, as well as welcoming the users who are posting on our sub for the first time.  
   \- Congratulating users who make it into our Top 25 most upvoted posts, as well as awarding them a special user flair.  
   \- Voting in our queue channel, where we decide if a post belongs in our sub.  

    Once you’ve completed these initial tasks, there are many other ways to get more involved in the moderation of our community if you’re interested!

### Comments
---
*This section covers training a new mod about how we use comments to create a friendly community. For each new mod learning Comments, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

   The first task that we'll be covering is comments on posts. As mentioned, we try to have a mod comment on every post. If you come across a post without one, feel free to step in! We hope that all mods will check for posts in need of comments once or twice a day. Additionally, you'll also notice the "needs-attention" channel in our Discord server. If a post has gone without a mod comment for over 5 hours, our bot will send us an alert there, so if you happen to see an alert and have the time, please comment on the post, then delete the alert.

   When making comments on posts, we ask that they be friendly and be unique (no copy-paste). Other then that, the message is entirely up to you. All comments should mention the user who posted, to alert them. To do this, you include "u/", followed by their username in your message. 

   You may notice that each user has a Level number assigned when they post.  We created this automated process using automoderator and each user's in-sub karma tally.  The levels are "First Post" and then Levels 1 (2 karma) - 68 (10,000 karma).  If you notice the post's flair is "First Post", please welcome them to r/MinimalistPhotography!

**Over the next couple days, ensure that the new mod has understood the instructions up until now, and is commenting properly and regularly. If you notice a lack of comments, feel free to give them a gentle nudge or ask them if they need help with anything.**

### Top 25
---
*This section covers training a new mod to aid in Top 25 Flairs and Congratulations. For each new mod learning this, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

**After a couple of days have passed since learning Comments, continue with the new mods training. They're now moving onto Top 25.**

   We're now going to cover the a new training step:  Top 25. This has to do with the posts that make it into our Top 25 most upvoted posts (ever), and can be found by sorting our subreddit's feed by "Top" -> "All Time". We congratulate every user who reaches the Top 25, as well as any of the other milestones (top 20, 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1). A couple things need to be done when a milestone (25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1) is acheived:

   If the user has made it into the Top 25, and they don't have the "Top 25 of All Time Photographer" user flair, please assign it to them. This is also true if they've reached the top 3, 2 or 1, with the "3rd Place All Time Top Photographer", "2nd Place All Time Top Photographer", and "1st Place All Time Top Photographer" user flairs respectively. It's important to note that these flairs are treated as trophys, so even if the user falls out of their position in the Top 25, they do not lose their flair.

   In addition to the user flairs, when a post makes it into one of the milestones mentioned above, they should be congratulated by a mod, via commenting on the post. The comment should follow the same guidelines as all other comments in our sub (friendly, no copy-paste, mention user), and let the user know their current milestone achieved. If you gave the user a new flair, you can also let them know in your comment.

   From time to time please look over the Top 25 of All Time and scan the dates of the posts.  If any have remained up in our Top 25 of All Time for a month and they have not been congratulated on passing that milestone, please add a comment to honor that achievement.

   Our bot, which I mentioned during the last stage of your training, will also let us know in the "needs-attention" channel when a post has made a milestone. Please do congratulations and flairs in addition to the welcome comments we discussed earlier, not instead of.

11. **Over the next couple days, ensure that the new mod has understood the instructions up until now, and is congratulating members and assigning flairs as needed. In addition, make sure that they are continuing to do the comments from Step 5. If you notice a lack of welcome comments or congrats/flairs, feel free to give them a gentle nudge or ask them if they need help with anything.**

12. **After a couple days have passed since Step 8, you should now give the new mod a choice between continuing on with training (Queue), or sticking with what they've learned so far. If they choose to continue with the training, proceed to [Queue](#Queue), otherwise, you can stop here. Please also make sure to give the mod the "General" role on Discord.**

      You've been doing an amazing job so far, and now you have a choice. You can either:

      \- Stop the training now, and continue to help with Welcome Comments, Congrats, and flairs, with the option to continue at a later date.  
      \- Continue on and learn queue, which is where we vote and decide on whether or not a post is minimalist.  

      Either option is fine, so it's up to you.

### Queue
---
*This section covers training a new mod to aid in Queue. For each new mod learning Queue, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

1. **Once the new mod has decided to continue with the training and learn queue, have them learn a little bit more about minimalistphotography.**

   Before you start voting in queue, I ask that you please take a look at our subreddits description, the links in our subreddits side bar, and the conversations in the defining-minimalism channel in our Discord server to give you a better sense of what minimalist photography is. You can also take a look at the posts in our sub to see what our mods consider minimalist. Let me know when you've done this, and we'll continue!

2. **Once the new mod has gotten back to you, saying they've taken a look at the places mentioned in Step 1, continue by explaining how our Queue works. (Automation, Reaction Meanings, Invite Posts)**

   One of the biggest parts of moderating our sub is curating the posts. We can get a lot of posts each day, so we've tried to streamline the voting process as much as possible. It's constantly changing as we think of better ways to do things, however as of right now, this is how it works:

   \- Our Automod will automatically remove all posts when they're made to our sub. (This includes mod posts).  
   \- Our bot will place all of the photos in the Reddit Queue into our "voting-and-discussion" discord channel, where the team can then vote on it.  
   \- Votes are made by reacting to the message.  
   \- Once 3 👍 reactions are made on a post, the Discord bot will delete the message on Discord, as well as approve the post on Reddit - it can take a minute.  
   \- If 3 👍 are not made, then Jwoods224 (One of the mods), will handle the actioning of the post. Only jwoods224 has authority to approve/remove posts.
   \- If the bot states that the post may be an invite, please check by following the modmail link provided.  
   \- If the image linked in the invite is the same as the image in queue, you can tell the bot to approve the post immediately by reacting to the post with the :autoapprove: emoji.  
   \- You should only vote with one of these (👍, 🤔, ❌, 👎) - however feel free to use these in addition to your main vote (🤮, 🔥, 😵‍💫).  
   \- All discussions about a post being voted on should take place in a seperate thread.  
  
   The emojis we currently use to vote on posts are the following:
   \- 👍: I think it's minimalist. It should be approved.  
   \- 🤔: I'm torn. It could be minimalist but it could also not be. I don't know which to choose.  
   \- ❌: Not minimalist. I think it should be removed.  
   \- 👎: Low quality. Ugly. Breaks Rules. Remove for other reason.  
   \- 🤮: I feel very strongly about this one. It should NOT be approved. Please vote no.  
   \- 🔥: I feel very strongly about this one. It should be approved. Please vote yes.  
   \- 😵‍💫: I think this needs to be talked about. Please don't action this until we've discussed. (This will also stop the bot from automatically approving the post when 3 👍 votes have been made.)  
  
   Does this all make sense to you? Do you have any questions?

3. **Once the new mods has said they understand Step 2, proceed to give them the "Queue" role in Discord and full permissions on Reddit.**
   
   I've given you access to the Queue channel here on Discord, as well as full mod permissions on Reddit. Now that you have full perms, please keep in mind that changes to our subs rules/description/design or any other changes are not made solely by one person, and are discussed by the entire team before hand. Please also do not action any posts in the Reddit queue, as all voting and actions should take place through the bot and jwoods224. Finally, please remember to continue doing Welcome Comments, Congrats, and flairs on Reddit. That takes first priority. You've been an amazing help. Thank you!

### Photo Pool
---
*This section covers training a mod to vote in the photo pool. For each mod learning this, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

1. **Once a mod has agreed to start voting in our photo pool, start by letting them know how it works, and the expectations for them.**

   The photo pool is where we vote whether to invite a user to post a specific photo in our sub. For the photo pool, we have higher standards than with queue: we believe it helps keep our sub filled with many high quality minimalist photos. To stock the photo poolm some of our mods search Reddit for images that could fit in our sub, and then will place them in the photo pool channel in Discord to be voted on by team members. Once votes have been made, we have designated mods who will then send the invite to the user (assuming the image was approved).

2. **Once the mod has read the above, and you've answered any questions they may have, continue on to explain the voting process.**

   The voting process for photo pool is in many ways like voting in Queue. The key difference is that you should be holding the images to a higher standard. A good way to think about it is: "Would this post make it into our Top 25?". Like with Queue voting, you use reactions (👍,❌,🤔,👎,🔥) to vote, with them all having the same meaning. A couple of other emojis we may use however are (1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, etc), which can be used to specify which image you're voting yes to if the provided post links to an album (a Gallery, a collection). At this point, you don't have to worry about the sending of invites, however if you'd like to help with that, feel free to let me know and we can cover it after.

3. **Give them access to the photo-pool by giving them the "Growth" role on Discord. Also go on to explain that they're allowed placing photos in the photo pool if they so wish.**

   I've now given you access to the photo-pool channel on Discord, so feel free to take a look there. At the top of the channel, you'll find some guidelines that you can read-through to make sure you fully udnerstand everything before voting. Finally, if you see a post elsewhere on Reddit that you feel would belong in our sub, it's A-Okay to place it in the photo pool to be voted on. Please just first ensure that the user has not already posted any photos to our sub, and have not been sent any invites already. (The only exception being if they've been sent just one invite and it was over 3 months ago).

### Invitations
---
*This section covers training a mod to send invites based on votes in photo pool. For each mod learning this, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

1. **Once a mod has decided to help in the sending of invites, start by letting them know how it works.**

   Invites are sent based on the results of votes in the photo-pool. You'll now be helping send these out. We have a modmail template that should be used when sending out the invites, and we'll go over the complete process now. before we start, do you have any questions?

2. **Once the mod is ready to proceed, explain to them what the requirements are for an invite to be sent.**

   Due to photo-pool images being held to a higher standard, the criteria for what posts we approve are different then Queue. For images in the pool, they must meet the following:

   \- Have unanimous upvotes (👍)  
   \- Have at least 3 upvotes (👍)

   If the image does not meet these conditions, then we won't send an invite for it, we just delete it. If the image has met these conditions, there are a few more things to check before sending an invite.

   \- Search modmail for any conversations with that user. (Do not include "u/" in the search).  
   \- Either no invitations have to have been sent previously, or there must have only been 1, having occured at least 3 months ago.  
   \- If the user has prior activity on our sub we might not send an invite (or we might reword the invite to acknowledge their participation). You can check by searching using our sub's search bar (it works with or without the "u/" before the username).

   If the image and user meet all of the conditions, then you can now send an invite. I'll go over how to do that, however first, do you have any questions?

3. **If the mod has no questions, or they've all been answered, then proceed to tell them how to send an invite.**

   To send an invite, first head over to Modmail and select the blue "+" icon. This will open up the draft for a new message. At the top, if it's not already, select r/minimalistphotography as the sender. Next, in the radio selection, choose the "To User" option. Place the user's username in the text box that should pop up (with u/). Now, choose the "Use a saved response" at the bottom, and pick the one named 'Invitation to Post (and join)'. Change PHOTO NAME to a short description of the photo and change PHOTO LINK to the URL of the photo we'd like the user to post. Keep in mind that the brackets and parentheses are part of the message and should not be changed. Before hitting send, add "Invitation to Post (and join)" as the subject of the message. Finally, send the message and remove the image from the photo-pool channel in Discord.

### Promotion
---
*This section covers training a mod to track mentions of our subreddit elsewhere on Reddit. For each mod learning this, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.*

1. **If the mod does not already have the "Growth" role on Discord, they should be taught [Photo Pool Voting](#Photo-Pool-Voting) first. Otherwise explain to them the quick and easy process involved.**

   We like seeing when people across Reddit mention our subreddit. To get notifications when someone uses "r/minimalistphotography" in a post or comment, we use \[RedditComber](https://redditcomber.com/). To set it up, simply sign in with your Reddit account and then enter "r/minimalistphotography" as a keyword it should alert you to. From then on, it will send you alerts to your Reddit inbox anytime someone mentions our sub on Reddit.

   When you get one of these notifications, if the comment/post did not take place in our sub, if it was complimentary/promotion, please copy and paste the link into the promotion channel - if it was a negative, please paste the link into the sub-talk channel. Due to us wanting to avoid any of our mods getting banned from any subreddits, please don't comment on these links. If you think a response may be necessary, just let us know when you share the link, and we'll discuss it as a team to reach a joint decision on the best course of action.

### Discord Tutorial
---
*This section provides a quick surface level tutorial for those new to Discord.*

Discord is where most of our moderating happens. It's where we manage the Reddit mod queue, where we hold mod votes and where we discuss our plans for the subreddit. Since you're new to Discord, here's a quick guide to get your started. If you want to learn a bit more, or you're still confused on a couple things, feel free to read Discords \["Beginners's Guide to Discord".](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

- What are Servers?
  
Servers are individual communities or groups on Discord where people with shared interests come together. Each server is divided into channels that can be for text chatting or voice chatting. In our case, our server is for the moderation of r/minimalistphotography.

- What are DMs?
  
DMs, or Direct Messages, are private one-on-one conversations between you and another user on Discord. They let you chat privately outside of a server. You can access them through the Direct Messages section on the home screen or by clicking a user’s profile and selecting "Message".

- How to Mention Someone
  
To mention someone in a server, type @ followed by their username or nickname. This sends them a notification and highlights the message for them, which is great if you want to get their attention.

- How to Add a Reaction
  
Adding a reaction is a fun way to respond to a message with emojis. Hover over the message you want to react to, and a smiley face icon will appear. Click it to open a menu of emojis, then select the one you want. The emoji will appear under the message for everyone to see. We also use reactions in a couple different places in our server, to aid in the moderation of our sub.

- How to Change Your Nickname in a Server
  
If the server allows nicknames, you can set a unique name for yourself in that server. Click the server name in the top-left corner, and from the menu, select "Edit Server Profile". Under "Server Nickname", enter your new name, save it, and it will display in that server only, without affecting your username elsewhere. For our server, we ask that it match your username on Reddit.

### Mod Tools Tour
---
*This section provides is for those mods who are interested to learn more about Mod Tools.

From our subreddit's page, if you haven't explored it yet, there is a feature called "Mod Tools" and we can provide a brief introduction now.

The set up of Mod Tools can vary from mobile to desktop and vary depending on which version of reddit you prefer (old.reddit.com or reddit.com).  The blue Mod Tools button opens up a sidebar on the left only visible to moderators of each subreddit.  There you will find a menu of tools to explore.  There is more here than we will outline here but feel free to look around and let us know if you have any questions.  This is the entrance to our queues, our  modmail inbox, and the area we used to create the design of our subreddit.  The removed queue is a good sampling of the types of photos the team has decided do not fit on our subreddit.  Also here is Wiki, which is the feature we use to design the content and appearance of our sub's side bar.  There is currently a glitch on accessing this section for some and the workaround involves accessing it this way:   r/replacewithyoursubhere/wiki/config/sidebar

The Reddit mod log has an important place in a mods toolkit. The mod log, which can be found in a subs mod tools, allows one to quickly and easily find a summary of all past mod actions. Feel free to take a look and see what everyone has been up to. If you want, you can even filter the results by mod, and take a look at everything you've done recently! Our primary use for the mod log is to ensure that no mods have accidently actioned a post without allowing the voting to proceed as normal. If you notice a post in mod log that had been approved/removed by someone other then Automod, u/binbang12, u/Jwoods224 or u/Unique-Public-8594, then please let us know in the sub-talk channel on Discord, so that we can decide on what to do with the post. You may notice that u/binbang12 is the one that approves/removes most of the posts in our sub and this is just because our Discord bot actions all the posts through that account.  

Another Mod Tool, Automod (or Automoderator), is a site-wide moderation tool on Reddit that all subs are able to set up and customize to meet their individual needs. You can find the setup for our Automod \[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalistphotography/about/wiki/config/automoderator/). Feel free to take a look through the setup, however please make sure not to change anything without the approval of Unique-Public-8594 (the mod in charge of our Automod). If you're interested in learning how it works, and how you could configure it, its \[documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/automoderator/full-documentation/) is a great place to start.

For our subreddit, we have it set up do to a couple different tasks. It's first task is that it will automatically remove all posts made in our sub, so that we may vote on it and decide whether it belongs in r/minimalistphotography. It's other job is to assign the post flairs that you'll see on each and every post in our sub. (The post flairs are the 'First Post', "Level 1 Member", "Level 2 Member", etc). It uses the in-sub karma of the person who posted the image to determine what flair the post should be given. That's why you'll notice that when posts by the same user are posted one right after the other, they'll be given the same flair. This is because they did not earn any in-sub karma in the short time between posting their first and second photo.

### Timing
---
*This section provides a quick explanation of when each module should be taught.*

From the time a new mod joins the team, they should be learning the various processes that we use to moderate our sub. Below is the order in which the new mod should be trained. This can be edited as needed, however this serves as a good baseline.

- First, if the new mod is not comfortable with Discord, they should be taught the [Discord Tutorial](#Discord-Tutorial) Module.
- If the new mod is comfortable with Discord, or has been given the [Discord Tutorial](#Discord-Tutorial) Module, they should next be taught the [Onboarding](#Onboarding) Module.
- Once the new mod has completed the [Onboarding](#Onboarding) Module, if they have agreed to continue with the training and learn Queue, teach them the [Queue](#Queue) Module. If they have not decided to continue, they should be asked again monthly.
- Once a week has passed since the new mod learned the [Queue](#Queue) Module, if they agree, teach them the [Photo Pool Voting](#Photo-Pool-Voting) Module. If they have not decided to continue, they should be asked again monthly.
- After a week has passed since the mod has learned the [Photo Pool Voting](#Photo-Pool-Voting) Module, if they'd like to help with the sending of invitations, teach them the [Invitations](#Invitations) Module. If they have not decided to continue, they should be asked again monthly.
- Once the mod had learned the [Invitations](#Invitations) Module, teach them [Promotion](#Promotion).
- After the new mod has completed all the previously mentioned Modules, teach them [Mod Log](#Mod-Log), wait a month, then teach them [Automod](#Automod).
