# Mod Training Handbook for Trainers
*This guide is designed to help you train new mods of r/minimalistphotography. Please follow the structure and steps outlined below, ensuring the new mod fully understands each part before moving on to the next.*

### 1. Invite the User to Our Mod Discord Server

**Action:** Send the user an invite to the mod Discord server. Ensure they know that Discord is where all the training and communication will take place.

**Message Example:**
> "Hi {username}, welcome to the mod team! I'm excited to get started with your training. I've sent you an invite to our mod Discord server, where we handle all our communications and training. Please join and I'll walk you through the next steps."

### 2. Start the DM with the User

**Action:** Start a direct message (DM) with the new mod on Discord to welcome them and set the expectations for the training process.

**Message Example:**
> "Hello {username}, welcome aboard! I’ll be guiding you through the training process, and I'm here to help whenever you need it. We’ll start with some basic tasks and gradually move on to more complex responsibilities. Please let me know if you have any questions along the way."

### 3. Send Mod Invite with 'Flair' Perms

**Action:** Send the user the mod invite with the appropriate permissions. After they join, remind them to assign themselves the 'mod' flair on Reddit.

**Message Example:**
> "I’ve just sent you the mod invite! Once you’ve accepted it, make sure to assign yourself the 'mod' flair so everyone knows you're a part of the team. Let me know if you have any issues."

### 4. Teach Comments

**Action:** Teach the new mod how to properly comment on posts. Emphasize the importance of engaging with the community, especially by commenting on posts without mod comments.

**Message Example:**
> "We try to have at least one mod comment on every post without a comment. It's essential for engagement. When you comment, make sure to be nice, personal, and unique—avoid copy-pasting comments. Try to work the posters username in as well, and if you see the post has the 'First Post' flair, welcome them to the sub. Here's a sample message:
>> "Hey {username}, welcome to the sub! Love the simplicity of this shot—great use of negative space. Looking forward to seeing more of your work!"

**Important:** Emphasize that every post without a mod comment needs one, that new members should be welcomed to the community, and that all comments should feel personal and thoughtful. Avoid copy-pasting comments. 

### 5. Monitor for a Couple of Days

**Action:** After teaching the new mod about commenting, monitor their activity for a few days to make sure they are commenting correctly. Remind them if they miss any posts without mod comments. Once you feel they're ready to continue, move on.

**Tip:** Encourage them to check recent posts for inspiration but remind them not to copy others comments.

### 6. Teach the Top 25 Flairs and Congratulatory Comments

**Action:** Teach the new mod how to give users their Top 25 flair and congratulate them when they reach milestones.

**Message Example:**
> "Once you see a post that’s in the Top 25 (by sorting the sub by ‘Top’ → ‘All Time’), give the poster the 'Top 25' flair. Make sure to congratulate them in the comments! This is in addition to the regular commenting you’ve been doing. Here’s a quick breakdown:
> - If the post has made it into the Top 25, check if they have the flair. If not, give it to them.
> - If they’ve achieved a milestone (25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2, 1), be sure to congratulate them in a comment too."

**Important:** Reiterate that this task must be done in addition to commenting, not instead of it.

### 7. Monitor for a Couple of Days

**Action:** Monitor the new mod’s activity to ensure they are consistently commenting on posts and also giving the Top 25 flair and congratulations when necessary.

**Tip:** Observe how they balance their tasks (commenting and Top 25), and provide feedback or guidance if needed.

### 8. Teach Queue Process

**Action:** Teach the new mod about the queue process, including how to vote on posts and approve/deny them based on the minimalist standards. Let them know that the Discord bot handles all actions Reddit-side

### 9. Monitor for a Few Days

**Action:** Continue to monitor the new mod’s work for a few more days to ensure they are handling all tasks effectively: comments, Top 25, and the queue process.

**Tip:** Provide feedback regularly and answer any questions they might have about how to manage the different tasks.

### 10. Teach Extra Tidbits (Rules, Plagiarism, Level System, etc.)

**Action:** Teach the new mod about additional key information they will need to know, including the rules of the subreddit, how to handle plagiarism, and anything else they may need to know.

**Message Example:**
> "Before you’re fully trained, there are a few extra things you need to know/do:
> - Rules: Check out the rules on the sidebar to make sure you're familiar with them.
> - Plagiarism: If you see a plagiarized post, don’t delete it yourself—bring it to the rest of the mod team, and we’ll discuss and ensure it is actually plagiarized before taking action.

### 11. New Mod Trains Their Own Mod

**Action:** Once the new mod has been successfully trained, they will begin training the next mod. Be sure to check in with them as they train their own mod, and provide assistance if needed.

**Tip:** Offer ongoing support as they take on the responsibility of training others.

## Closing Notes for Trainers:

**Be Patient:** Remember that learning to moderate is a process. It’s okay if the new mod makes mistakes—help them learn from them!

**Provide Positive Reinforcement:** When the new mod does well, be sure to praise them! Positive reinforcement is key to building confidence.
