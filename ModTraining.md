## Lessons

### Open DM
---
*Open a DM with the user. This is where the users training will take place, and where they can raise any questions, comments or concerns.* 

**Potential Message:**

Hello {user}, I'm happy you decided to join our Mod Team! I'll be guiding you through the quick training process, that way you can hit the ground running. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out and I'd be happy to help however I can. Until I give the go ahead, please refrain from doing anything besides commenting, as we run our sub in a very unique way, which needs explanation. If it's alright with you, I'd like to get right in to this, that way you can get going as soon as possible.

### Time Zone
---
*Ask for the users time zone, and give yours. This will help with scheduling and communication.*

**Potential Message:**

Right away, I'd like to ask whether or not you're willing to share your time zone. While it is not necessary, it may help with coordination. My time zone currently is {Mod's time zone}.

### Moderation Process
---
*This step is to explain the unqiue moderation process that we use to moderate r/minimalistphotography. This will help give new mods a better understanding of what they are stepping into.*

**Potential Message:**

I'd now like to let you know a bit more about our moderation process on this sub. It is unqiue compared to other subs, and is a lot more time consuming, hence the number of mods we have. As a team, we personally welcome all new members to the subreddit, via commenting on their first posts. In addition, we try to have at least one comment on each post, as it drives up engagement and help create the feeling of a supportive active subreddit. In the beginning, you will share in this responsability, however, there are other jobs that you can take on if you so wish. To help the growth of our subreddit, we try to invite ~10 users a day to join our sub. To avoid spam, we are very selective in who we choose. We vote on every potential invite as a mod team, and, if/when an invite is sent, we include the photo that we hope the user will post, as well as our reasoning behind why we feel they'd be a great addition to our sub. Finally, our queue. In the spirit of maintaining quality minimalist photos, the mod team of r/minimalistphotography votes on all photos that users attempt to post (Our automod immediately removes all posts, so that we may vote on it). Once a photo is deemed minimalist, or not, then, a mod will either approve or deny the post in queue, depending on the result of the vote. Do you have any questions or concerns?

### Reddit Group Chats
---
*Add the new mod to the Reddit Group Chats, explaining their purpose. This will help in the orientation of the new mod, and help with the flow of information.*

**Potential Message:**

Continuing on, I'd like to invite you to our 2 mod chats on Reddit. They are "Mods - Minimalist Photography", and "MinimalistPhotography friendship". The names are pretty self explanatory however the first is for sub related topics, and the second is for the mod team to communicate as friends. Feel free to pop into either and say hello.

### Mod Subreddit
---
*Invite the new mod to MP mods, and explain the purpose of it*

**Potential Message:**

As a team, we have a private subreddit as well as a private Discord server. For now, I'd like to invite you to the subreddit. In it, you'll be able to see that this is where we carry out any votes as a team, as well as mark any vacation we are taking. (In the pinned post). This is to ensure that everyone knows how many mods are able to actively moderate at a given time.

### Mod Intro Wiki
---
*Unique has graciously written out a Wiki entry to help the introduction and training of a new mod. Send the user to it.*

**Potential Message:**

One of our mods (Unique-Public), has graciously create a Wiki entry to help in the training. This will be the longest part of the training (~15min), however we ask you to read it through and follow any intructiions, as it will give you some of the basic building blocks needed to help moderate. You can find the entry here: https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalistphotography/about/wiki/mod_handbook/

### Upvote Posts
---
*Ask the new mod to upvote all posts on r/minimalistphotography that they see. Emphasise that this is not mandatory, as we cannot tell someone how to vote.*

**Potential Message:**

Small little thing, to help give the sub a lively feeling, we ask that you upvote all posts that you see. This is not mandatory, as we can not tell you how to vote, however it would be much appreaciated.

### Rules
---
*Show the rules and ask if any explanation is needed.*

Our sub has a few rules. These rules are not very complicated, or very obscure, however we ask that you check them out, and, if you have any questions or concerns, please let us know. The rules can be found on the sidebar here: https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalistphotography/
