## Lessons

### Open DM
---
*Open a DM with the user. This is where the users training will take place, and where they can raise any questions, comments or concerns.* 

**Potential Message:**

Hello {user}, I'm happy you decided to join our Mod Team! I'll be guiding you through the quick training process, that way you can hit the ground running. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out and I'd be happy to help however I can. Until I give the go ahead, please refrain from doing anything besides commenting, as we run our sub in a very unique way, which needs explanation. If it's alright with you, I'd like to get right in to this, that way you can get going as soon as possible.

### Time Zone
---
*Ask for the users time zone, and give yours. This will help with scheduling and communication.*

**Potential Message:**

Right away, I'd like to ask whether or not you're willing to share your time zone. While it is not necessary, it may help with coordination. My time zone currently is {Mod's time zone}.

### Moderation Process
---
*This step is to explain the unqiue moderation process that we use to moderate r/minimalistphotography. This will help give new mods a better understanding of what they are stepping into.*

**Potential Message:**

I'd now like to let you know a bit more about our moderation process on this sub. It is unqiue compared to other subs, and is a lot more time consuming, hence the number of mods we have. As a team, we personally welcome all new members to the subreddit, via commenting on their first posts. In addition, we try to have at least one comment on each post, as it drives up engagement and help create the feeling of a supportive active subreddit. In the beginning, you will share in this responsability, however, there are other jobs that you can take on if you so wish. To help the growth of our subreddit, we try to invite ~10 users a day to join our sub. To avoid spam, we are very selective in who we choose. We vote on every potential invite as a mod team, and, if/when an invite is sent, we include the photo that we hope the user will post, as well as our reasoning behind why we feel they'd be a great addition to our sub. Finally, our queue. In the spirit of maintaining quality minimalist photos, the mod team of r/minimalistphotography votes on all photos that users attempt to post (Our automod immediately removes all posts, so that we may vote on it). Once a photo is deemed minimalist, or not, then, a mod will either approve or deny the post in queue, depending on the result of the vote. Do you have any questions or concerns?

### Reddit Group Chats
---
*Add the new mod to the Reddit Group Chats, explaining their purpose. This will help in the orientation of the new mod, and help with the flow of information.*
