*This section goes over the process of onboarding a new mod. This includes letting them know our expectations of all mods, as well as getting them set up.*

**For each potential new mod, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.**

1. Explain the requirements and expectations of all mods on the team, those being:

     Before we contin with the training, I'd just like to cover our expectations of every mod on the team. We ask that all mods respect the following:
    - Dedicate 5-10 minutes a day to mod tasks, such as commenting on posts.
    - Notify the team in the Discord server if you're unnable to partipate for any reason
    - Maintain a respectful and kind tone in all interactions with both the mod team and community members.
    - Actively participate in mod discussions on Discord, where we collaborate on decisions and improvements for the subreddit.

3. Once the new mod has agreed to step 1, go on to explain that the way we moderate r/minimalistphotography is unique, and provide an overview as to what we do differently.

   I'd now like to share a bit about our moderation process, as we do things differently to a lot of other subreddits. Some of the things we do differently are:
    - Every post submitted to our subreddit is reviewed and voted on by the mod team to determine if it aligns with our concept of minimalism. (Which is constantly evolving as we learn and work with each other)
    - We aim to have at least one mod comment on every post. This is an important part of what we do, as we believe it helps foster a welcoming and engaged community.
    - Some of our mods actively search for high-quality minimalist photos across Reddit. If we find a post that aligns with our concept of minimalism, we'll send the user a thoughtful modmail invitation, explaining why we think their image would be a good fit for r/minimalistphotography.

5. Answer any questions the new mod may have, then continue on to explain the training process that they will go through.

   The training process is designed to help you learn the tasks that need to be done to keep the subreddit running smoothly. To avoid overwhelming anyone with too much new information, you'll learn a new task every couple of days. The tasks that you'll be learning over the next week or so, in this order, consist of the following:
      - Commenting on posts made in our sub, as well as welcoming the users who's first time it is posting to our sub.
      - Congratulating users who make it into our Top 25 most upvotes posts, as well as awarding them a special user flair.
      - Voting in our queue channel, where we decide if a post is minimalist and belongs in our sub.

    Once you’ve completed these initial tasks, there are many other ways to get more involved in the moderation of our community if you’re interested!

6. Answer any questions the new mod may have, then start by teaching them Step 1: Comments.

   The first task that we'll be covering is comments on posts. As mentioned, we try to have a mod comment on every post. If you come across a post without one, feel free to step in! We hope that all mods will check for posts in need of comments once or twice a day. Additionally, you'll also notice the "needs-attention" channel in our Discord server. If a post has gone without a mod comment for over 5 hours, our friendly Discord bot will send us an alert there, so if you happen to see one and have the time, please comment on the post, then delete the alert.

   When making comments on posts, we ask that they be nice, be personable, and be unique (no copy-paste). Other then that, the message is entirely up to you. All comments should also mention the user who posted, so as to alert them. To do this, you include "u/", followed by their username in your message. Finally, if you notice the posts flair is "First Post", please welcome them to r/MinimalistPhotography!.
