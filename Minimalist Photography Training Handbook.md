### Onboarding
---
*This section goes over the process of onboarding a new mod. This includes letting them know our expectations of all mods, as well as getting them set up.*

**For each potential new mod, the steps below should be completed, with adjustments made as needed on a case-by-case basis.**

1. Explain the requirements and expectations of all mods on the team, those being:

     Before we contin with the training, I'd just like to cover our expectations of every mod on the team. We ask that all mods respect the following:
    - Dedicate 5-10 minutes a day to mod tasks, such as commenting on posts.
    - Notify the team in the Discord server if you're unnable to partipate for any reason
    - Maintain a respectful and kind tone in all interactions with both the mod team and community members.
    - Actively participate in mod discussions on Discord, where we collaborate on decisions and improvements for the subreddit.
  
2. Send the user a mod invite on Reddit. They should be given the "user" and "flair" perms to begin with. Once you've done this, let them know and ask them to give themselves the 'Mod' flair.

3. Once the new mod has agreed to step 1, go on to explain that the way we moderate r/minimalistphotography is unique, and provide an overview as to what we do differently.

   I'd now like to share a bit about our moderation process, as we do things differently to a lot of other subreddits. Some of the things we do differently are:
    - Every post submitted to our subreddit is reviewed and voted on by the mod team to determine if it aligns with our concept of minimalism. (Which is constantly evolving as we learn and work with each other)
    - We aim to have at least one mod comment on every post. This is an important part of what we do, as we believe it helps foster a welcoming and engaged community.
    - Some of our mods actively search for high-quality minimalist photos across Reddit. If we find a post that aligns with our concept of minimalism, we'll send the user a thoughtful modmail invitation, explaining why we think their image would be a good fit for r/minimalistphotography.

4. Answer any questions the new mod may have, then continue on to explain the training process that they will go through.

   The training process is designed to help you learn the tasks that need to be done to keep the subreddit running smoothly. To avoid overwhelming anyone with too much new information, you'll learn a new task every couple of days. The tasks that you'll be learning over the next week or so, in this order, consist of the following:
      - Commenting on posts made in our sub, as well as welcoming the users who's first time it is posting to our sub.
      - Congratulating users who make it into our Top 25 most upvotes posts, as well as awarding them a special user flair.
      - Voting in our queue channel, where we decide if a post is minimalist and belongs in our sub.

    Once you’ve completed these initial tasks, there are many other ways to get more involved in the moderation of our community if you’re interested!

5. Answer any questions the new mod may have, then start by teaching them Step 1: Comments.

   The first task that we'll be covering is comments on posts. As mentioned, we try to have a mod comment on every post. If you come across a post without one, feel free to step in! We hope that all mods will check for posts in need of comments once or twice a day. Additionally, you'll also notice the "needs-attention" channel in our Discord server. If a post has gone without a mod comment for over 5 hours, our friendly Discord bot will send us an alert there, so if you happen to see one and have the time, please comment on the post, then delete the alert.

   When making comments on posts, we ask that they be nice, be personable, and be unique (no copy-paste). Other then that, the message is entirely up to you. All comments should also mention the user who posted, so as to alert them. To do this, you include "u/", followed by their username in your message. Finally, if you notice the posts flair is "First Post", please welcome them to r/MinimalistPhotography!.

6. Over the next couple days, ensure that the new mod has understood the instructions up until now, and is commenting properly on posts. If you notice a lack of comments, feel free to give them a gentle nudge or ask them if they need help with anything.

7. Once a couple days have passed since Step 5, continue with the new mods training. They're now moving onto Top 25.

   We're now going to cover the second part of your training, Top 25. This has to do with the posts that make it into our Top 25 most upvotes posts (ever), and can be found through sorting our subreddit's feed by "Top" -> "All Time". We congratulate every user who reaches the Top 25, as well as any of the other milestones (20, 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1). A couple things need to be done when a milestone (25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1) is acheived

   If the user has made it into the Top 25, and they don't have the "Top 25 of All Time Photographer" user flair, please assign it to them. This is the same for if they've reached the top 3, 2 or 1, with the "3rd Place All Time Top Photographer", "2nd Place All Time Top Photographer", and "1st Place All Time Top Photographer" user flair respectively. It's important to note that these flairs are treated as trophys, so even if the user falls out of their position in the Top 25, they do not lose the flair.

   In addition to the user flairs, when a post makes it into one of the milestones mentioned above, they should be congratulated by a mod, via commenting on the post. The comment should follow the same guidelines as all other comments in our sub (kind, personable, no copy-paste, mention user), however should also let the user know their current position. If you ended up changing or giving the user a new flair, you can also let them know if your comment.

   Our friendly Discord bot, which I mentioned during the last stage of your training, will also let us know in the "needs-attention" channel when a post has made a milestone, so this task doesn't require too much time. Please make sure you do this in addition to the comments we discussed a couple of days ago, not instead of.

8. Over the next couple days, ensure that the new mod has understood the instructions up until now, and is congratulating members and assigning flairs as needed. In addition, make sure that they are continuing to do the comments from Stage 5. If you notice a lack of comments or congrats/flairs, feel free to give them a gentle nudge or ask them if they need help with anything.

9. After a couple days have passed since Step 7, you should now give the new mod a choice between continuing on with training (Queue), or sticking with what they've learned so far. If they choose to continue with the training, proceed to step 10, otherwise, you can stop here. Please also make sure to give the mod the "General" role on Discord.

    You've been doing an amazing job so far, and now you have a choice. You can either:

     - Stop the training now, and continue with Comments and Top 25, with the option to continue at a later date.
     - Continue on and learn queue, which is where we vote and decide on whether or not a post is minimalist.

   Either option is fine, so it's up to you.

11. If the new mod decides to continue with the training and learn queue:
