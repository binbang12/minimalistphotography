# r/minimalistphotography Mod Guide

Welcome to the moderation team of [r/minimalistphotography](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalistphotography)! We're excited to have you onboard as we continue to grow and support our vibrant community of photography enthusiasts. Since our inception, we’ve expanded significantly, growing from 277 members in April 2023 to over 4,000 today. As a mod, you play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and engagement of our subreddit. This guide will help you get started and understand your responsibilities. The estimated read time for this guide is about 10 minutes.

## Time Commitment

Moderating r/minimalistphotography requires a modest time commitment. We ask that you spend a few minutes, one or two times a day, at your convenience. This is a baseline expectation and can vary depending on the day and any additional responsibilities you choose to take on.

## Moderation Overview

Our moderation process involves several key steps:

- **Personal Welcomes**: Each first-time poster receives a welcome comment from a mod. Multiple mods can comment, and just because you see one comment doesn't mean you shouldn’t add your own.

- **Post Review**: All posts are initially removed by automod. Only the mods assigned to the queue vote on whether the post should be approved or denied. Ensure that only the mod assigned to the queue handles this process.

- **Approval or Denial**: Based on the votes, a mod will either approve or deny the post. Ensure that only the mod assigned to the queue handles this process.

## Upvote Posts

To help give the subreddit a lively and engaging atmosphere, we ask that you upvote posts. This is not mandatory, but it is appreciated as it contributes to the overall activity and visibility of the content.

## Comments

As part of our engagement strategy, we strive to have at least one mod comment on every post. Comments should be kind, personable, and unique—avoid copy-pasting. When commenting on posts with the “First Post” flair, make sure to welcome the user to the subreddit. Even if a post already has a comment, it’s okay to add another.

## Top 25 Posts

Posts in the top 25 are highlighted with special flair. If you see a post in the top 25 without the appropriate flair, please add it. Users who drop out of the top 25 retain their flair, so no action is needed in that case. Periodically check for congratulatory comments on milestones and add your own when necessary.

## Reddit Group Chats

You will be added to two Reddit group chats:
- **Mods - Minimalist Photography**: For sub-related discussions.
- **MinimalistPhotography Friendship**: For informal communication among the mod team.

Feel free to join both and introduce yourself.

## Mod Subreddit

We have a private subreddit, [r/MPmods](https://www.reddit.com/r/MPmods), where we vote on mod decisions and track mod availability. Please join this subreddit to stay informed about our team's activities and decisions.

## Rules

Our subreddit has a few straightforward rules. Please review them on our sidebar [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalistphotography/). If you have any questions or need clarification, don’t hesitate to ask.

## Modmail

Our modmail can get quite busy, especially with our daily invitations to new users. Check modmail for messages with subjects like "Invitation to join and post." Archive these messages if:
- The user has not replied, or
- A user replied but another mod has already responded.

Do not interact with modmail messages that do not meet these criteria. If you take on additional responsibilities, you may be more involved with modmail.
